- Added Russian translation, by jose

- If Ideology is installed, autopsies have a chance of spawning skulls
- Added support for autopsy of creatures from [Call of Cthulhu - Cosmic Horrors](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765890823)
- Removed legacy reference to HugsLib

Remove organs and bionics from corpses.
		Factors that influence the success chance:
		- doctor skill of the worker
		- corpse age (after 24 hours it is almost impossible to succeed)
		- room surgery success chance and infection chance
		- quality and material of the table (silver!)
